File list is dynamic grid component, if you resize applet files per row reflects changes.

File chooser component you see on the left is platform special, which means if you are on a unix based computer it show root folder and your home folders as main folders, if you are on windows machine your documents folder, desktop folder and some other special folders listed as main folders.

Here you can show all selected files and remove some of them if you want to. This list is very useful when you want to find an image that you do not want to upload, because normal list just lists the selected directory.

**File Upload Limiting Functionality**

Starting from the 1.2 version, you can put a limit to uploads. If you add "fileUploadLimit" parameter to applet parameters, a progressbar component which indicates selected file count will be visible so that user know what is the upload limit. If you do not provide the parameter progressbar will not be visible.

**PS.** : I am using Ubuntu 6.10 ;) http://www.ubuntu.com
